 ### Nukes a user's cart clean :bomb:

With this plug-in, marketplaces users can clear the contents of their content with one click. If used as is, this plug-in only works on Arcadier's front end.

But the main function of this plug-in is found in the `user` folder, where the [Delete Item in Cart](https://apiv2.arcadier.com/?version=latest#f7fc984c-b492-4622-85ce-5646d1dc756d) API is called on loop on a user's cart.
